The problem with static personal websites are they don't have the social features the web offers: sharing, liking, commenting, following.
The problem with social media is they want to keep you locked in to their platform and abuse.

Linkfeed allows you all of the social media features on your static personal website.

The way it works is your post an <iframe src="https://linkfeed.io/feed/yourusername"></iframe> on your personal website at /feed. This will display your Linkfeed on your personal website.
Also, you can post an <iframe src="https://linkfeed.io/profile/yourusername"></iframe> on your personal website at /profile. This will display your profile on your personal website.
